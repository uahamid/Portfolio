        <p>For this project, I was tasked to design a health based webpage. I decided to focus on women's reproductive health, and created HerHealth Hub. The process began with preliminary user research, followed by the creation of a user persona of my target audience, and then designing the page using Figma. My goal was to develop a comprehensive webpage that not only offered informative content and resources but also showcased my design skills in color theory, typography, and layout. Through strategic design choices, I aimed to create an engaging and user-friendly platform that catered to the diverse needs of women seeking reproductive health information and support. </p>

        <p>For this project, I was tasked with the challenge of designing an app using Figma, with a focus on functionality. Introducing "Budgy", a budgeting app tailored for young adults, aimed at empowering users with financial management tools and resources for enhancing financial literacy. Through Figma, I seamlessly integrated wireframing, prototyping, and creative design elements to bring Budgy to life. Each element of the app was meticulously crafted to provide a user-friendly experience, from expense tracking features to educational resources on financial literacy. This project not only showcases my proficiency in Figma and app design but also highlights my ability to merge functionality with creativity to address real-world needs.</p>
